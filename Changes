	  XSLT functions

	- Added &convert_outline method. 

	- No longer loads CGI.pm; writes HTML for breadcrumbs by hand.

	- Breadcrumbs are passed to the stylesheet as a parameter rather 
	  munging the HTML file after transformation.

	- No longer loads HTTP::Browser; not much point if the code that 
	  goes along with it still hasn;t been written.

	- Removed &init and moved code into &handler

	- $gObj_xpath is not created until after a possible outline has 
	  been converted to XBEL.

	- Added $gVar_xbel_bak to record path to actual file in the event 
	  of conversion.

	- Added hooks to read output-escaping config from conf file and pass 
	  it along as an XSL param.

	- Added cleanup handler to reset $gVar_xbel_file and call XML::Xpath 
	  cleanup method.
